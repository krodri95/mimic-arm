# ðŸ’ª Mimicking Robot Arm ðŸ¤–

**mimic-arm** is a two-segment planar robot manipulator designed to mimic human arm movements. Its motion is precisely guided using forward kinematics, with joint angles derived from shoulder, elbow, and wrist points detected using **MediaPipe** Pose landmark detection.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies

`pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy Pillow`

### Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/krodri95/mimic-arm.git`

### Run

`python main.py path/to/video`

Make sure the video includes your face. I have masked my face in the demo so that the focus is on the arm ðŸ˜‰.

## ðŸ§  How it Works

### Forward Kinematics of a Two-Segment Planar Robot Manipulator

Determine the position of the end effector based on the lengths of the segments and the angles of the joints.

#### Definitions:

- **l<sub>1</sub>**: Length of the first segment (upper arm)
- **l<sub>2</sub>**: Length of the second segment (forearm)
- **Î¸<sub>1</sub>**: Angle of the first joint
- **Î¸<sub>2</sub>**: Angle of the second joint

#### Equations:

1. Position of the second joint
    - x<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub> Â· cos(Î¸<sub>1</sub>)
    - y<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub> Â· sin(Î¸<sub>1</sub>)

2. Position of the End Effector
    - x = l<sub>1</sub> Â· cos(Î¸<sub>1</sub>) + l<sub>2</sub> Â· cos(Î¸<sub>1</sub> + Î¸<sub>2</sub>)
    - y = l<sub>1</sub> Â· sin(Î¸<sub>1</sub>) + l<sub>2</sub> Â· sin(Î¸<sub>1</sub> + Î¸<sub>2</sub>)

### Methodology

First, the **left shoulder**, **left elbow** and **left wrist** points were converted into vectors. Then, the angles between these vectors were calculated using the dot product, and the direction was determined using the cross product.
